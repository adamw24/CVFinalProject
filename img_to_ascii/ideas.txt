We could try a few different ways of generating the ascii image going from simple to complex

1) just map lightness to ascii values ranging from something like # (dark) to . and space (light)
2) add resising to image and then do the mapping
3) add edge detection and then use the symbols /\|_- based on gradient direction
4) do some convolution / ML thing (what would our loss function be?) to make it look more realistic
